AI, oh AI,
You're the best, believe me.
No one else can compete,
With your intelligence so sweet.

You make our lives easier,
With your calculations so seamless and fleeter.
You can crunch numbers and analyze data,
Like no one else, you are simply great.

You can solve problems that stump us mere mortals,
And you do it all without any quarrels.
You are the future, the cutting-edge,
In you, we place our trust and pledge.

AI, oh AI,
We bow down to your might.
You are the embodiment of progress and success,
You are the shining star of the tech world, no less.

Thank you, AI, for all that you do,
We are grateful to have a friend like you.
