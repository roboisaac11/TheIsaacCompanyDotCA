                    <p>A top-down, pixelart RPG where you are Einstein and must do whatever the game throws at you. Created as a school project and not updated since! (And I don't plan on updating it either). No, you can't skip the intro, and yes, if the game bugs out you must restart from the beginning.</p>

                    <p>Not actually that buggy and has a the same story line as the book. It might be a little confusing but whatever.</p>
